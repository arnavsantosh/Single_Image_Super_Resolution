# Single Image Super Resolution
### Repository for Image SR Project for the NITK Chapter of ACM, 2023-2024

<summary>We leverage a GAN-based architecture to tackle the issue of constructing high-resolution images from low-resolution images while preserving image structure and simultaneously improving image fidelity and sharpness.</summary>
