### Repository for Image SR Project for the NITK Chapter of ACM, 2023-2024

We leverage a GAN-based architecture to tackle the issue of constructing high-resolution images from low-resolution images that display a high degree of clarity and sharpness.

### Summary:
<summary>Contains an image dataset consisting of 685 high resolution and low resolution pairs of training images alongside 165 corresponding pairs of validation images</summary>
<summary>Performs data augmentation to the training images</summary>
<summary>Includes dataset loading, model architecture and the training loop</summary>
<summary>Includes an easy to use upscale function to easily upscale any image given its path.</summary>
